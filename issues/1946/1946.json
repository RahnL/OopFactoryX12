    "Description": "Hi,\n\nI just downloaded the latest version 3.08 and noticed that the HCFA 1500 GIF file (HCFA1500_Red.gif) was still the old version (version 0938-0999 from 08/2005).  Does anybody know where I can get the latest one (0938-1197 from 02-2012) in GIF format.  The latest approved version has 12 lines vs. 4 lines for the Diagnoses (Line 21).\n\nThanks you in advance...\n\nSteve\n\n\nIf you could, please help test branch:\n\n[https://x12parser.svn.codeplex.com/svn/branches/837Typed/](https://x12parser.svn.codeplex.com/svn/branches/837Typed/)\n\nInitial rendering of a 02/12 CMS-1500 was added.",
