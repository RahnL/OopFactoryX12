    "Description": "We have a requirement to split (unbundle) a file that may include multiple ISA's with multiple GS's into multiple files that each contain a single ISA\\GS. There are methods for unbundling by transaction and by loop, but no UnbundleByFunctionGroup(). Any chance we could see that method in a future release?",
