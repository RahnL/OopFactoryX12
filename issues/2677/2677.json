    "Description": "I downloaded 3.0.8 and tried X12 to XML for an 856 ASN. I ran into Issue 1508. This was supposedly fixed way back when as indicated in this comment: \n\ndstrubhar wrote Feb 17, 2013 at 1:35 PM\n\nYou are correct. I have fixed this serialization to keep the segments with Trailer=\"true\" at the bottom. It is in changeset http://x12parser.codeplex.com/SourceControl/changeset/23145 and I will be doing a release within the next few weeks.\n\nIs this code fix in v3.0.8? Thanks.",
