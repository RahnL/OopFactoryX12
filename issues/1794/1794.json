    "Description": "(Moved from discussion board)\nFirst, Thanks for this tool, it is truly awesome.\n\nI am using \nClaimDocument document = service.Transform837ToClaimDocument(stream.BaseStream);\nand then working on each claim\nforeach (Claim claim in document.Claims)\nFrom there I am turning each claim into a UB04\nUB04Claim Ub04 = _transformation.TransformClaimToUB04(claim);\nand then using the UB04 object to load into my DB.\n\nI am not getting any data in the Ub04.Field05_FederalTaxId field.\nbelow is the x12 snippet that contains the Hospital Information (de identified):\n\n`\nHL*1**20*1~\nPRV*BI*PXC*123N12345X~\nNM1*85*2*SPRINGFIELD HOSPITAL*****XX*1234567890~\nN3*123 FAKE ST~\nN4*SPRINGFIELD*IN*123456789~\nREF*EI*987654321~\n`\nThe tax id for the hospital: `REF*EI*987654321~` is showing up in Ub04.Field57_OtherProviderIdA.\n\nIf you fix this please let me know where.  Or can you direct me where I would find the code and I'll take a stab at it.\n\nThanks much, Doug Schmidt\n\nP.S On a side not the process that outputs a pdf of the 5010 claim isn't working quite correct as well.  My code is as follows.\n\nXmlDocument foDocument = new XmlDocument();\nstring foXml = service.TransformClaimDocumentToFoXml(document);\nfoDocument.LoadXml(foXml);\nvar driver = Fonet.FonetDriver.Make();\ndriver.Render(foDocument, @\"c:\\temp\\FileName.pdf\");\n\nI have several PDFs of the originals printed at the hospital and the created PDF with your parser with comments written on them from the billers in the company I work for.  Not sure if I can de identify them but I'm sure I can find a way if you would like me to send the PDFs to you.\n\nThanks again.",
