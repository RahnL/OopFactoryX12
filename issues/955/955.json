I added all of your samples to the unit test but I did need to add another space to your ISA08 segment that needed 15 characters instead of 14 characters.\r\nThe last step to get it into the format you need is to perform one more XSLT transformation to replace the generic Loop elements with the ones from your XSD.  I will try and get that posted tomorrow.  That won't be a change to the parser, I will just post a sample project on a documentation page that shows you how to do that.",
