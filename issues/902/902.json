    "Description": "Would it be possible to get a transaction set to support x12.852 \"Product Activity Data\"? I hope I am asking for the right thing as I am very new to EDI and trying to pick this up and integrate it. I'm having a very hard time trying to actually find the 852 specifications without signing up for $500+ memberships, so if anybody can tell me where that type of information is found as well, that would also be greatly appreciated, but I digress. Please let me know if an 852 set is possible or if there is anything I can do to help aid in this request.\nÂ \nThank you!",

The work this specification will probably take about an hour, which I can probably get to in the next weekish.  I can add it to the current source code, though I don't expect to do another release for a 3-4 more weeks.  I can also show you how to inject the specification into the current release.",
