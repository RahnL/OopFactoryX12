    "Description": "Are you guys trying to do the same thing? Austin looks like he wants to output an existing X12 file into a flat format/excel. EdiGuy, it looks like you are trying to populate the X12 data model to output a new file from scratch. \n\nAnyway, Austin, per the instructions here: [Creating a flat file or Excel file from the X12 xml using XSLT and XslCompiledTransform](https://x12parser.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Creating%20a%20flat%20file%20from%20the%20X12%20xml%20using%20XSLT%20and%20XslCompiledTransform) state that you can use xslt to transform the parsed xml file into any format you want. This page has a download link to the sample project that loads and applys the xslt. I have an interest in flattening an 834 myself, so if I ever get around to it I'll let you know.",
