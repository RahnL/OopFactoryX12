    "Description": "Would it be possible to incorporate the 110 & 210 transaction sets into the parser? I'm not sure how complicated they are to add, and I understand if it's not on your project road map. However, I would be very grateful if it was.\n \nI am looking to write a freight pay system at work and would like to use your application for to translate the EDI files into XML.\n \nThank you for your time,\nChris Story",
