      "Message": "Sorry, I have not been able to get to this yet.  It has to do with the OopFactory.X12.Parsing.UnbundlingService which is called from the X12Parser.UnbundleByLoop method.  I thought I had created unit tests for all these at OopFactory.X12.Tests.Unit.Unbundling.UnbundlingTester, but it appears that I did not create a test for LoopId 2000.  I have promoted your role to developer.  You are welcome to looking into a fix or at least adding a unit test for your LoopId 2000 that should be expected to pass once we find a fix.  It might be mid September before I can focus some time on this issue.",
