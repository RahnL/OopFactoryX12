    "Description": "Good evening, \n\nI am coming across an error when trying to process 856 files after they have been converted to EDI documents using TransformToX12 with the 856 transaction set. The issue is that the CTT segment is getting written directly after the BSN, rather than at the end of all HL segments, just prior to the SE segment. \n\nThis is the case with both 4010 and 4030 X12 standards documents.",
