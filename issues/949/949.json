    "Description": "First I have to say thanks.  I was about start writing my own parser and you and the dev team have just saved me weeks of work.  Second your design is great. I consider myself a decent programmer but you guys have awesome skills.\nAlong those same lines I spent a few hours trying to find where to start.  I think I have the hang of the parser and now need to make an acknowledgement 997 file for a 5010.  Does the capability exist to make one or can you point me in the right direction if you have already made that module. Thanks, Doug.",
