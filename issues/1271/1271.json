Thank you.\n \nMike Allen",

Emdeon is a large medical clearing house in the US.  I wouldn't think would generate 277 CAs that were not \"spec\" compliant.  Let me do a little research and check their 277 companion guide to see if this is the case.  I will post what I find out.\r\n\r\nAgain, thanks to both of you.",
