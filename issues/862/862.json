If you need special formatting you should do an xslt transformation into one of the Xml formats of Excel.\r\nI did a transformation with about 20 columns of the 835 and that took me a couple of hours.\r\n\r\nSince this is not reporting a bug, I am going to close this issue.  If you need additional help please start a discussion thread and I will answer your questions there.\r\n\r\nThank you for considering this tool in your solution.",
