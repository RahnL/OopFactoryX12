    "Description": "I am using the x12parser.exe utility and there does not seem to be a way via command line or config file to set the throwExceptionOnSyntaxErrors = false.  I even tried adding it to the x12parser.exe.config, but it does not seem to take the setting.  Am I doing something wrong?  \n\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<configuration>\n<startup><supportedRuntime version=\"v4.0\" sku=\".NETFramework,Version=v4.0\"/></startup>\n  <appSettings>\n    <add key=\"MaxBatchSize\" value=\"10000000\"/>\n\t<add key=\"throwExceptionOnSyntaxErrors\" value=\"false\"/>\n  </appSettings>\n</configuration>\n\nBelow is the error I received from the command line.\n\nUnhandled Exception: OopFactory.X12.Parsing.Model.TransactionValidationException\n: Segment 'NTE**DEMAND TRANSFER.

Perhaps the dev team on this project will think about your suggestion to add that as an option for folks who wish to use it.\r\n\r\nWith that said however,  I do want to at least say I do not personally recommend using this setting. It hides the fact that it may not be properly parsing documents causing data loss. Your trading partners may not be aware they are sending invalid data and if you cannot provide them this information quickly a lot of bad data can be passed before it is ever noticed. When this happens it makes everyone look bad.",
