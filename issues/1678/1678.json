    "Description": "When I ran the command to create the PDF, it gives me the error: \"Unable to retrieve graphic from HCFA1500_Red.gif\".\n\nI don't think it is looking for the image files in the same directory as the EXEs, by default.\n\nWhen I write code to do this and pass the exact location of the GIFs, it works fine.",
