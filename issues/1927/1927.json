    "Description": "Greetings,\n\nI have some 837 files > 15MB size; while trying to parse is I am noticing the parser is unable to parse/ serialize more than 2.5 MB file size. Generating SystemOutOf Memory error. Also noticed the error below.\n\nPlease advice how to work with big files.\n\n\nSegment 'SVD*07202*227.36*HC:A0427:SH:GM**1' in segment position 3252 within transaction '000000012' cannot be identified within the supplied specification for transaction set 837 in any of the expected loops: 2000A[85],2000B[96],2300.  \n\n\nTo change this to a warning, pass throwExceptionOnSyntaxErrors = false to the X12Parser constructor. Parameter name: 837",

SVD is expected as child of a service line which is a LX segment.  In your case it is appearing the claim level so the file has a syntax error.
