    "Description": "I have a file that is ~120mb, I know that the X12Parser can handle larger as I also parse files that are 200+mb without an issue.  The issue I'm running into is that the file has Multiple HL1 loops with a null parent which from what I see the X12 parser tries to push into different Files.  I.E.  the first HL1 goes into an _1 file, the second into a _2 file, etc.  I can parse into the _1.xml file just fine, but when it tries to create the _2.xml file it throws an out of memory exception.",
