When i am trying to wrting this to PDF report, it is showing only first line service number in \r\n\r\nRemttanceFileContent --> Transactions --> Check--> Header--> ClaimPayments--> ServicePayments.\r\n\r\nWhich is leading to issue in preparing report. If you can fix this issue, i can transform a bunch of files to standard PDF form.",

Kindly look into this. so, i can go head and start working on this.\r\n\r\n\nThanks.\nchowdary.",
