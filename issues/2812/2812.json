    "Description": "Per the discussion I posted a couple of years ago (https://x12parser.codeplex.com/discussions/546182), there is an issue parsing __856 - Advanced Ship Notice__ documents using this project. Looking at the most recent source code located under ___/trunk/src/OopFactory.X12/Specifications___ this still appears to need patching. \n\nI am attaching what I did in order to remedy this. It works in my production environment, so perhaps this could be included in a future update for this project? Although based on my recollections, the modified XML file might not strictly adhere to ANSI 856-4010 standards. But it was my attempt to patch this project so that I could parse these 856's, which definitely weren't being handled by the versions of OopFactory.X12 noted in my discussion thread.\n\nYour feedback is welcomed :)",
