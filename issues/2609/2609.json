    "Description": "I'm just starting to deal with EDI, so I'm a total newb and I'm trying to get a handle on it.\n\nI've written a simple app to go through the POs that we get and I'm dumping information about the interchanges, function groups, transactions and segments and so forth I got this exception in one of the EDI messages:\n\nSegment 'MTX**APPOINTMENTS REQUIRED 72HRS   IN ADVANCE. CARRIER TO UNLOAD,' in segment position 8 within transaction '0001' cannot be identified within the supplied specification for transaction set 850 in any of the expected loops: N9.  To change this to a warning, pass throwExceptionOnSyntaxErrors = false to the X12Parser constructor.\n\nThis is the beginning of the transaction up to where it fails.\n\n```\nSE*17*0001\nST*850*0002\nBEG*00*SA*6047266661**20150112\nREF*IA*00000000\nITD*05*3*****10\nDTM*002*20150119\nTD5****M\nN9*L1*SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS\nMTX**APPOINTMENTS REQUIRED 72HRS   IN ADVANCE. CARRIER TO UNLOAD,\n\n```\n(I zeroed out one of the numbers).\n\nI don't understand the error, however. Can someone explain it?",
