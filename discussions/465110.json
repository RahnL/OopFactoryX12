It starts with enrollees being in a flat structure called CMSEnrolleeImport. Issuers would just need to transform their EDI/Enrollment data into this format before generating the 834 Effectuation files. I'll be done with it within a week or so. It is written in VB.NET but should easily convert to C# via online converters. Is there a place to put user contributed code?<br />\n",
