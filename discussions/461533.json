Now I'm on to creating an outbound 852 Product Activity Data document for testing.<br />\n<br />\nThe two loops I seem to be having trouble getting to be seen as valid are the ZA loop and CTP segment. I am including these using the AddLoop() and AddSegment() methods after creating the initial LIN loop. Are these types defined in this project? I am pretty familiar with syntax and usage, as I have developed my solutions for 850 and 856 document types using the X12 Parser.<br />\n<br />\nPlease let me know when time permits. Thanks again and great work on all of this!<br />\n",

When I commented out the ZA loop then the CTP segment that follows it throws the same runtime exception when it hits the first segment in that particular loop.<br />\n<pre><code>            // Define the stock item type being reported on.\n            seg = _852trans.AddLoop(&quot;LIN&quot;);                                                    \n            seg.SetElement(2, &quot;UP&quot;);                                                           \n            seg.SetElement(3, &quot;123456&quot;);                                                       \n\n            // Define the activity reporting type and product specifics.\n            seg = _852trans.AddLoop(&quot;ZA&quot;);                                                      \n            seg.SetElement(1, &quot;QA&quot;);                                                            \n            seg.SetElement(2, &quot;1&quot;);                                                             \n            seg.SetElement(3, &quot;EA&quot;);                                                            \n            seg.SetElement(4, &quot;007&quot;);                                                           \n            seg.SetElement(5, currentDate.ToString(&quot;yyyyMMdd&quot;));                                \n            seg.SetElement(6, &quot;ST&quot;);                                                            \n            seg.SetElement(7, &quot;001&quot;);                                                           \n            \n            // Define the pricing information.\n            seg = _852trans.AddSegment(&quot;CTP&quot;);\n            seg.SetElement(1, &quot;RS&quot;);                                                            \n            seg.SetElement(2, &quot;WHL&quot;);                                                           \n            seg.SetElement(3, &quot;100.00&quot;);                                                        </code></pre>\n\n",
