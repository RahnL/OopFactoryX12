The Claim object denomalizes all this so that all attributes of the claim appear in that one object.  So even though it is possible to transform the Claim object back to x12, it would take away the decision of how to group all the provider, subscriber and patient loops.\r<br />\n<br />\nFor this reason it is better to leave that decision up to the user and use the Interchange object directly to create the desired X12.  The discussion mentioned above will point the the unit test sample that shows how to do this.<br />\n",
