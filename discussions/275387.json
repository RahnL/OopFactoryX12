The main loops that translate to the standard forms are for the most part untouched.  It would be harder to do it the other way, only because there would be no translation of ICD-10 diagnosis codes once those start getting transmitted.</div>\n<div>Do you want to make this open source? I can add you as a developer if you want to add that to the OopFaxtory.X12.Hipaa assembly.</div>\n<div>Before you do this work, you may want to ask if you clearinghouse will already do this, most of them are already prepared to do the conversions both ways. Your local system doesn't necessarily need to handle 5010, you just need an interface (such as a  clearinghouse) that will.</div>",
