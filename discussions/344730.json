I saw the examples and Test projects but could not find such a thing. Am I missing something.<br>\r\nIf this feature is missing then I would like to work on it to make it a new feature in X12Parser.<br>\r\nX12 parser is very helpful and makes generating EDI documents very very easy. Good work.</p>\r\n",
