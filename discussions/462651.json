This can be deleted.<br />\n<br />\nFirst, Thanks for this tool it is truly awesome.<br />\n<br />\nI am using <br />\nClaimDocument document = service.Transform837ToClaimDocument(stream.BaseStream);<br />\nand then working on each claim<br />\nforeach (Claim claim in document.Claims)<br />\nFrom there I am turning each claim into a UB04<br />\nUB04Claim Ub04 = _transformation.TransformClaimToUB04(claim);<br />\nand then using the UB04 object to load into my DB.<br />\n<br />\nI am not getting any data in the Ub04.Field05_FederalTaxId field.<br />\nbelow is the x12 snippet that contains the Hospital Information (de identified):<br />\n<br />\n<code>HL*1**20*1~<br />PRV*BI*PXC*123N12345X~<br />NM1*85*2*SPRINGFIELD HOSPITAL*****XX*1234567890~<br />N3*123 FAKE ST~<br />N4*SPRINGFIELD*IN*123456789~<br />REF*EI*987654321~</code><br />\nThe tax id for the hospital: <code>REF*EI*987654321~</code> is showing up in Ub04.Field57_OtherProviderIdA.<br />\n<br />\nIf you fix this please let me know where.  Or can you direct me where I would find the code and I'll take a stab at it.<br />\n<br />\nThanks much, Doug Schmidt<br />\n<br />\nP.S On a side not the process that outputs a pdf of the 5010 claim isn't working quite correct as well.  My code is as follows.<br />\n<br />\nXmlDocument foDocument = new XmlDocument();<br />\nstring foXml = service.TransformClaimDocumentToFoXml(document);<br />\nfoDocument.LoadXml(foXml);<br />\nvar driver = Fonet.FonetDriver.Make();<br />\ndriver.Render(foDocument, <a href=\"mailto:@&quot;c:\\temp\\FileName.pdf&quot;);\n\nI\" rel=\"nofollow\">@\"c:\\temp\\FileName.pdf\");\n\nI</a> have several PDFs of the originals printed at the hospital and the created PDF with your parser with comments written on them from the billers in the company I work for.  Not sure if I can de identify them but I'm sure I can find a way if you would like me to send the PDFs to you.<br />\n<br />\nThanks again.<br />\n",
