But that may not be the case either.\r<br />\nThe format looks like it was created to be human readable and not automation readable.\r<br />\n<br />\nI am not sure why someone is giving you these files, but it appears to be a proprietary format.  Perhaps you can ask them for the raw x12 files that generated these files.  Most everyone receives claims as x12 or as paper, so there must have been some internal program that generated this.<br />\n",

And it adheres to the official UB-04 data spec. \r<br />\n<br />\nUnfortunately, we have to live with this format because that's the only format this particular Provider supports (for now). We receive 4010 and 5010s (raw X12 files) from all other providers and your X12 parser has been a huge blessing!\r<br />\n<br />\nBased on your feedback, it appears I am going to have to write a parser from the ground up to make it automation readable by referring to the UB-04 spec (lines1-4 are provider name and address, left justified, positions 1-20, etc).\r<br />\n<br />\nOnce again, thank you for your response.\r<br />\n<br />\nKind Regards,\r<br />\nnk5491<br />\n",
