I'm new to it but it looks great so far.\r<br />\n<br />\nSecond, we have a requirement to split (unbundle) a file that may include multiple ISA's with multiple GS's into multiple files that each contain a single ISA\\GS.  There are methods for unbundling by transaction and by loop, but no UnbundleByFunctionGroup().  Any chance we could see that method in a future release?\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks!\r<br />\nTom<br />\n",
