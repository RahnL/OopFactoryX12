The TA1 messages have no version</p>\r\n<p>In looking at the parser source code, it looks like changes would need to take place in a couple of locations:</p>\r\n<p>- The X12Parser.Parse method inside the segment switch statement</p>\r\n<p>- The SpecificationFinder.FindSegmentSpec method</p>\r\n<p>- The SpecificationFinder.FindTransactionSpec method</p>\r\n<p>I think we can add in support for these TA1 messages, but the way we're going about it seems wrong/hacky ...so could you please advise as to the best way to add support for this? The additional problem/constraint is that the TA1 messages may have multiple\r\n TA1 lines in it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thank you.</p>\r\n",
