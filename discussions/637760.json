Im a very new developer, so viewing the 835parser is not easy for me to digest. If i can attach the input file arg[0] and output file args[1] to file open and save dialog prompts, then i think all that would be left, is to somehow edit the column headers in the xml response. So instead of the loop segment name, it would have the human readable version instead. <br />\n",
