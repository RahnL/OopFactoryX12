Thank you in advance. It may sound dumb being that our clearing house does this for us, however we get charged 6 cents for each claim and we have 1/2 mill members so.... $$$<br />\n<br />\nOur system only loads 837 4010 so we would have to convert from 5010 to the 4010 format.<br />\n<br />\nAlso when sending out information we have to use the 5010 format which in looking at the code I see we can build something based off your product.<br />\n<br />\nThanks in advance.<br />\n",
