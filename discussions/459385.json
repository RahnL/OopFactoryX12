The problem is the xml can have multiple Loop elements of different types on the same level, which is common in a lot of X12 EDI transaction sets.  An xsd won't allow two elements of the same name with different types.<br />\n\r<br />\nIs there anyway to make the outputted xml adopt different names for the &lt;Loop&gt; element when using a custom xsd?<br />\n",
