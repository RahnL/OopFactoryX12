    "Html": "Greetings!\r<br />\n<br />\nIn DetachedSegments.cs, the SetElement(string) method throws an exception if the input string contains either of the two edi delimiters. Is there a way to just filter out the delimiter characters from the value before they are set in the element instead of throwing an error? Obviously I could run every value through a filter before I set properties on the x12 model classes, but that would be hundreds of updates to my code, and very repetitive. I could also modify the DetachedSegment class to do this, but I'd prefer not to modify the library so I can maintain an upgrade path.\r<br />\n<br />\nHas anyone found a way to do this through other means?\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks!<br />\n",
