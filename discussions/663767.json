    "Html": "Hi all,\r<br />\nI have been doing EDI for many years and recently developed an EDI parser for the company I work for. I had to create a lot of classes, one per EDI doc segment. The parser I created handles the 850, 860, 856, and 810. The OopFactory.X12 dll was included in an app provided to our DBA to parse a medical document. Unfortunately the app did not work, but I noticed the use of this dll. Going through some of the source code provided to the DBA, I noticed the use of the &quot;X12Parser.TransformToX12&quot; and I was like... wow! I asked my self... how does it transform it? There has to be a schema somewhere. So, I googled it and that's how I arrived to this page. I downloaded the source code and I found this project really amazing. It looks like one simply needs to provide the XML with the EDI segment identifiers and it will use the proper transformation file. \r<br />\n<br />\nKudos to all contributors! This is really cool!\r<br />\n<br />\nIs the project still being maintained via GitHub?\r<br />\n<br />\nJose.<br />\n",
