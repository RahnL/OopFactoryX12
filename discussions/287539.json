Line 2, position 63.</p>\n<p>I have traced down into the code and it is happening because the XSLT does not understand the binary character in the stream yet it is parsed just fine by the X12 Parser. That part it is talking about it segment-terminator attribute in the Interchange tag.</p>\n<p>This is a valid X12 transaction and we do tens of thousands of these a day so I am not sure why it is failing here and not supporting. Is there a workaround I can use in the meantime for this to generate good HTML?</p>\n<p>Thanks guys and keep up the good work!</p>",
