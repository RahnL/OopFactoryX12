And if I really need it to be round-tripable, what should I do? Attempt to create a 2nd 856 implementation with a different Ansi-856-4010Specification.xml file, in which the //Segment[SegmentId = 'CTT'] comes in the\r\n other location (at the end of the 1st HL)?</p>\r\n<p>Also, can you give the link to the actual spec so I can see what it says?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks,<br>\r\nBob Eaton</p>\r\n",
