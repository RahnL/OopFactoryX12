With that said, I have successfully implemented the tool to parse 837 files directly into a sql server database out of box like the straight forward instructions illustrate.  I now need to pull data OUT of the database various ways.\r<br />\n<br />\nAre there any canned queries out there that anyone has to pull information into a sql result set (for example):  \r<br />\n<ul>\n<li>\nDistinct claim information joining to... Subscriber Information<br />\n</li>\n</ul>\nI am having trouble understanding how to join the tables noted in the SQL section that outlines the database schema that gets created with this awesome tool.  For example, I understand how to join Segment to NM1 to get subscriber information but do not understand how I can join subscriber information to N3 to obtain subscriber address information.<br />\n\r<br />\nThank you,<br />\n",
