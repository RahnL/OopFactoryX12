In debugging, it appears to be because the incoming 837 has some claims where they pass in a name only for a Service Location. <br />\n<pre><code>NM1*77*2*PATIENTS HOME~</code></pre>\n\nThere is no address line 1, city, state, zip, etc. The source in TransformClaimToHcfa1500 does not seem to handle this. I've tried adding a check:<br />\n<pre><code>if (serviceLocation.Address.Line1 != null)</code></pre>\n\nBut the check itself throws the NullReferenceException. Any idea how to handle this?<br />\n",
