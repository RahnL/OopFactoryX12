Which means User will create 1 .XSLT for each of the payer and save it on his PC.</p>\r\n<p>3) .XSLT should be read dynamically rather than added to the project as static.</p>\r\n<p>4) After transforming the data should be loaded to DataTable or Dataset to export to database.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Where as i am failing in step 2 and 4. XSLT is shwoing as null if i am tryign to read it runtime and how to load the .XSLT into stream rather than static.</p>\r\n<p>How to write the read data to DS or DT rather then text file.</p>\r\n<p>Thank you.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
